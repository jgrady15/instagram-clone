# Created with React.js and Google Firebase

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm install @material-ui/icons`
### `npm install --save firebase`
### `npm install react-router-dom`

**These are dependencies** 

This project uses Material UI for Icons and Google Firebase for the backend. This project will not work unless you install both of these dependencies.
